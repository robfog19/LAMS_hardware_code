# LAMS_hardware_code

A repository for the code that will be used for all of the sensors and communicators for the LAMS device.  

The folder getAcceleration contains code pulled from the DFRobot website for getting data from the accelerometer.

The file read_serial.py contains code for reading from the serial port on a PC, which is to be used to get data over the bluetooth connection.
